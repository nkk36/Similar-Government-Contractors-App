# Similar Government Contractors

This is a repository for a Shiny application that gives the results of clustering government contractors according to the types of services they provide. This application is intended to supplement the [Clustering Government Contractors](https://github.com/nkk36/Clustering-Government-Contractors-App) app. Whereas Clustering Government Contractors is meant to be interactive and educational allowing the user to set various parameters for clustering on a small subset of data, this app allows the user to search through the results from clustering on the entire data set. The application was created using R Shiny.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes, however you will need to contact me for the data which was too large to store on GitHub. I am looking into methods for compressing the data so I can store it here. Below you will find a list of packages and their versions used to create the application. 

### Prerequisites

Here is a list of packages which you will need to run the application. You will also need all of their package dependencies as well. **This application was created using R 3.4.3.**

| Packages        | Version |
| --------------- |:-------:|
| dplyr           | 0.7.4   |
| DT              | 0.2     |
| markdown        | 0.8     |
| shiny           | 1.0.5   |
| shinydashboard  | 0.6.1   |

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
